One of the most famous piece of code used to introduce novice to programming languages

The first known version of the program written by Brian Kernighan is found in a tutorial to the B language

```c
main(){
  extrn a,b,c;
  putchar(a); putchar(b); putchar(c); putchar('!*n');
  }

a 'hell';
b 'o, w';
c 'orld';
```

Followed by its C language version

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main( )
{
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

And written in the same language as the universe [_(Source)_](https://xkcd.com/224/)

```lisp
(print "Hello world")
```
