Hi my name is Hugo Bidois, aka "Hrafven".

I am a full stack developer in web, mobile and iot technologies.

On my website you will find posts about technologies, programming languages, and the projects I work on.
You will also find interesting pieces of code with their analysis under the [CODE](/code/) section

The custom wants the first piece of code written to be a [hello world](/code/hello_world/) program
